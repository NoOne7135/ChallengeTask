## Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

## Run Backend App

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
```bash
cd backend
```
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
If you do not create an environment, it may give an error.
Paste the full path to uvicorn instead of uvicorn (the path will most likely be indicated in the error)  
Example:
```bash
C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Packages\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.12_qbz5n2kfra8p0\LocalCache\local-packages\Python312\Scripts\uvicorn.exe main:app --reload
```

## Run Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
```
```bash
npm i
```
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Run Odds Calculation

```bash
cd backend
```
```bash
python odds_calculation.py
```

## Run API Test
(Without changing the odds, the test will fail with an RTP value of 0.6 â€“ 0.7; when changing the odds, the test will be passed with an RTP value of 0.93 - 0.97, requires time)  
```bash
cd backend
```
```bash
pytest api_test.py -s
```

## Odds Calculation Result
With the condition that Pair is only Pair, 2 Pairs are not taken into account  
Other: 0.0  
Pair: 1.43  
Full House: 2.86  
Yahtzee: 4.28
